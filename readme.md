# Employee API

This is a simple API to manage users in a database.

# Setup

The .env file has two values

  + authHeaderKey. This is to mock out authorization. Put whatever you like and set it in the front end index.js file as well.
  + mongoConnectionString. Use this to set your mongo database connection string.

Create and place those values in the .env file.

### Installation

Install the dependencies and start the server.

``` sh
$ npm i
$ nodemon 
```

Or

``` sh
$ node server.js
```
